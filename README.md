This is a repository for the final assignment of the course 'Introduction to Deep Learning' (5511) of the Master of Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.
For this assignment I chose as a subject the 'Natural Images' classification challenge on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasunroy/natural-images).

The data set in this challenge was originally created for research on deep learning achitectures and it consists of 6.899 images across eight categories.
Naturally, the challenge is to classify each image correct. The categories are:

- Airplane
- Car
- Cat
- Dog
- Flower
- Fruit
- Motorbike
- Person

This notebook contains: 
- Exploratory data analysis
- Training and testing of 4 convolutional neural networks
- Conclusion

Because of the size of the notebook it might not be completely visible in GitHub. 
In that case please use this link: https://nbviewer.org/github/RM-CUBoulder/5511_FinalAssignment/blob/main/5511-finalassignment.ipynb
